AIM:

To write an embedded C program for interfacing ADC and DAC and verify the output
in the ARM kit.
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED:

PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
ADC:

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Initialize the LCD.
Step 3: Intialise the ADC.Set the port line P0.29 to have the special function ADC input,
using the PINSEL1 register
Step 4: call the routine message_display1 to display message”ADC demo” on line 1 of the
LCD. Call the routine message_display2 to display message”channel2;” on line 2 of
the LCD.
Step 5: a) set the control register of the ADC with the following
specifications;
Channel number=2;
ADC clock=3 MHz.
Select burst mode,
Conversion clocks required =11clocks
b) start the ADC conversion
Step 6: Wait for EOC Once the EOC signal is obtained read the ADC valve.
Step 7: Display the ADC value on the LCD.
Repeat from step 4.
Step8: Stop the program

DAC:

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Initialize the DAC.Set the port line P0.25 to have the special function DAC,
using the PINSEL1 register
Step 3: Set the value 0 to DAC
Call a delay
Step 4: Set the value 0xFFC0 to
DAC Call a delay.
Step 5: Repeat step 2
Step 6: Stop the program

RESULT:

Thus the Embedded C program for interfacing ADC and DAC was written and executed.
The output was verified in the ARM kit.
