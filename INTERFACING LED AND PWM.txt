AIM :
To write an embedded C program for interfacing LED and PWM and to verify the output
in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED :
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

Algorithm:
LED
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Enable IO port. Initialize timer 0.
Step 3: a) Initialize P0.19 (A0), P0.20 (A1), P0.22 (A2) as output port. These three lines
are the Control lines to the decoder, use to the generate the chip enable signal for
the LEDs.These line are called as address lines
b) Initialize the data lines P1.16 (DB0) toP1.23 (DB7) as output lines.
Step 4:a) Place the data for the LEDs in the data busDB0 to DB7.Set data to switch on one
LED
b) Clear all address lines as A0, A1 and A2. Then set all address lines back to 1 to
enable The latch connected to the LEDs
Step 5: Call a delay.
Step 6:a) Rotate the data for a LEDs to switch on next
LED.
b) Repeat from step 2
Step 7: Stop the program.

PWM
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: a) Initialize LCD.
b) Display a message on the LCD
Step 3: Initialize PWM. Initialize a variable Var to 900.
Set the direction to port lines P0.0 and P0.07 TO 0in the direction register
Step4:Check for 0level in P0.01lines where a push button switch connected.
Step5:Check for 0 level in P0.07lines where a push button switch connected.
Step 6: Stop the program
