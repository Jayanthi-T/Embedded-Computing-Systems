AIM:
To write an embedded C program for interfacing stepper motor and temperature sensor
and to verify the output in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
Stepper motor:
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Initialize IO port lines.
Step 3: a) Initialize P0.19 (A0), P0.20 (A1), and P0.22 (A2) as output port. These three lines are the
Control lines to the decoder, used to generate the chip enable signal for the stepper motor. These
lines are called as address lines.
b)Initialize data lines P1.16 (DB0) to P1.23 (DB7) as output lines.
c)Set the address lines asA0=1, A1=1 and clear the address line A2.
Step 4: Initialize counter 1 to100.
Step 5: a) Initialize a counter to 4.
b) Place a data 0X6666 in the data bus.
Step 6:a)toggle the address line A0 from 0 to 1,to enable the latch connected to the stepper motor
Driver.
b) Call a delay.
Step7:a)shift left the data 0x6666 once
b)Decrement the counter by 1.
c) Repeat from step 5 until the counter becomes 0.
Step 8:a) Decrement the counter1 by 1.
b) This makes the motor rotate in clockwise direction for few seconds.
c) Repeat from step 4 until the counter1 becomes 0.
Step9: Initialize counter 1 to100.
Step 10:a) Initialize a counter to 4.
b) Place a data 0X6666 in the data bus.
Step 11:a) toggle the address line A0 from 0 to 1,to enable the latch connected to the stepper
Motor Driver.
b) Call a delay.
Step12:a)shift right the data 0x6666 once
b)Decrement the counter by 1.
c) Repeat from step 10 until the counter becomes 0.
Step 13:a) Decrement the counter1 by 1.
b) This makes the motor rotate in counter clockwise direction for few seconds.
c) Repeat step 9 until it becomes 0.
Step 14: Repeat from step 3
Step 15: stop the program.

TEMPERATURE SENSOR
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: initialize LCD
Step 3: initialize ADC. Set the port lines AD0.1to has a special function using the PINSEL1
Register.
Step 4: Call the routine message_display 1 to display message “room temperature” on line one of
the LCD.
Step 5: a) Set the control register of the ADC with the following specifications
Channel number=2;
ADC clock=3 MHz
Select burst mode.
Conversion clocks required=11 b)
Start the ADC conversion
Step 6: Wait for EOC signal. Once the EOC signal is obtained, read the ADC value
Step 7: Convert the read valve into BCD and then display the room temperature on the LCD
module..Repeat from step4.
Step 8: Stop the program.

RESULT:
Thus the Embedded C program for interfacing stepper motor and temperature sensor was
written and executed. The output was verified in the ARM kit.
