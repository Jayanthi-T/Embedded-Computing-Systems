AIM:

To write an embedded C program for interfacing EEPROM and interrupt and to
verify the output in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
  
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
EEPROM:

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Initialize the LCD
Step 3: Initialize IIC interface
Step 4:a)Set the address location of EEPROM as 0x00
b) Set the data as 0x12
c) Call routine to write byte to EEPROM.
d) Call the delay
Step 5:a)Set the address as 0x00 for reading from
EEPROM
b) Call routine to read from EEPROM
Step6:a)Displaythe
address
b) Halt
Step 7: Stop the program

INTERRUPT:

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: a) Initialize the IO lines
b) Initialize an eight bit counter to 0.
Step 3: a) Allocate vector interrupt controller slot 0 for EINT0 by programming
VICVectCntIO Register with 0x2e.
b) Allocate vector interrupt controller slot 1 for EINT2 by programming
VICVectCntI1 Register with 0x30.
c) VICVectAddr0 register is initialized with address of the interrupt service
routine for EINT0 .
d) VICVectAddr1 register is initialized with address of the interrupt service
routine for EINT2 .
e) Slot 1 and slot 0 are enabled by writing VICIntEnable register with valve
0x00014000.
Step 4: Stop the program

RESULT:
Thus the Embedded C program for interfacing EEPROM and interrupt was written and
executed. The output was verified in the ARM kit.
