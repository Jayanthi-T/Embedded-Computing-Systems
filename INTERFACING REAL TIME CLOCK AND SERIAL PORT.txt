AIM:
To write an embedded C program for interfacing real time clock and serial port
and to verify the output in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED :
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
Real Time Clock:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Initialize LCD.
Step 3: Initialize IIC interface.
Step 4: Set the address location of RTC as 0X04.
Step 5: Set the address location of RTC as 0X03.
Step 6: Set the address location of RTC as 0X02.
Step 7: Display the read data hours, minutes and seconds on the second line of the
LCD. Repeat from step3.
Step 8: Stop the program.

SERIAL PORT:
Step 1: Star t the program
Step 2:a) Initialize Io lines.
b) Initialize the serial port.
Step 3:Send an initial message through serial port to PC.
Step 4: a) Initialize LCD.
b)Display messages on both lines of LCD.
Step 5: Initialize keyboard lines.
Step 6: Initialize timer 0 to generate interrupt for every millisecond. the keyboard is scanned
for Key press in the timer 0interrupt routine
Step 7: Check for a character from a serial port receiver buffer. Also check for a key
press.
Step 8: Repeat from step 6.
Step 9: Stop the program
