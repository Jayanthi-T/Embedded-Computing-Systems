AIM:

To write an embedded C program for interfacing keyboard and LCD and to verify
the output in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED:  

PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:

KEYBOARD:

Step1:Start the program
Step2:a) Initialize the
IO lines
b) Initialize LCD
Step 3: Display the messages on both lines
of LCD
Step 4: Initialize keyboard lines
a) Set P0.11 to P0.14 as input lines
b) Set P0.15 to P0.18 as output lines
Step 5: Initialize timer 0 to generate interrupt for every millisecond
Step 6: Check the keyboard flag for 1 level. Read the key from the keyboard
code. Clear the Keyboard flag variable.
Step 7: Display the pressed key valve on the 2 line of the LCD using display
byte routine. Repeat from step 5
Step 8: Stop the program.

LCD:

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Initialize the IO port lines
Step 3: a) IntializeP0.19 (A0), P0.20 (A1), P0.22 (A2) as output port.
b) Initialize data lines P.16 (DB0) to P1.23 (DB7) as output lines
c) Initialize the control lines of LCD, P1.24(R/W) and P 1.25(RS) as
output lines.
Step 4: Initialize LCD
Step 5:a)send command 0x80 to display string on line 1 of LCD.
b) Send character one by one until all 16 characters are
displayed.
Step 6:a)send command 0xC0 to display string on line 2 of
LCD.
b) Send character one by one until all 16 characters are
displayed.
c) halt
Step 7:Stop the program.

RESULT:

Thus the Embedded C program for for interfacing keyboard and LCD was written and
executed. The output was verified in the ARM kit.
