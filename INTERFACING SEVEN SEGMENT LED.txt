AIM:
To write an embedded C program for interfacing seven segment LED and verify the output
in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED :
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
SEVEN SEGMENT LED:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Initialize IIC interface
Step 3: Send the instruction byte 0X00 to the IIC device.
Step 4: Send the instruction byte0X01 to indicate that next byte is segment data fo digit 1.
Step 5: Send the instruction byte 0X02 to indicate that next byte is segment data for digit 2.
Step 6: Send the instruction byte 0X03 to indicate that next byte is segment data for digit 3.
Step 7: Send the instruction byte 0X04 to indicate that next byte is segment data for digit 4.
Step 8: Stop the program.

RESULT:
Thus the Embedded C program for interfacing seven segment LED was written and
executed. The output was verified in the ARM kit.
