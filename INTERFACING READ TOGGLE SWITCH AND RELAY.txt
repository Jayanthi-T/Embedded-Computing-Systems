AIM:
To write an embedded C program for interfacing read toggle switch and relay and to
verify the output in the ARM kit.

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED :
PC
EMBEST IDE
ARM Evaluation kit

ALGORITHM:
READ TOGGLE SWITHES :

Step1: Start the program

Step2:InitializeIO portlines.

Step 3: Initialize P0.19 (A0), P0.20 (A1), and P0.22 (A2) as output port. These three
lines are the Control lines to the decoder, used to generate the chip enable signal
for the point LEDs in The toggle switches. These lines are called as address lines.

Step 4:a) Initialize data lines P1.16(DB0)to P1.23(DB7) as input lines.
b) Set the address lines as A1=0,A2=0 and toggle the address line A0 from 0
to1,to enable The buffer connected to the switches.
c) Read the data from the data bus.

Step 5: a) Initialize the data lines P1.16(DB0) toP1.23(dDB7) as output lines
b) Write the data read from the switches to the data bus for LEDs.
c) Set the addresses lines as A0=0, A1=0 and A2=0 to enable the latch connect to
the LEDs

Step 6: Repeat from step 3.

Step 7: stop the program.

RELAY:
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: initialize IO lines required for the relays
Step 3: Intilize P0.30 (relay 1) and P0.10 (relay20) as output lines.
Step 4: Send 1 level to P0.30 and 0 level to P0.10. Call a small delay.
Step 5: Send 0 level to P0.30 and 1 level to P0.10. Call a small delay.
Repeat from step 3
Step 6:Stop the program.

RESULT:
Thus the Embedded C program for interfacing read toggle switch and relay was written
and executed. The output was verified in the ARM kit.
